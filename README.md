# Grimoire
A collection of scripts and utilities to help unicorns do their jobs efficiently and effectively!

# Contributing
Scripts are grouped by category-ish, either find a place that your script/util fits, or create a new folder(s) for it to live in.

Ideally scripts are unopinionated on the environment they run in, but this isn't always possible.

Each script is self contained in a camelCase folder that includes documentation about how it works and how to use it:

## Script README.md Example
```
# Purpose
Explain reasoning for script existence

# Usage
How to use it, parameters, flags, etc.

# Notes (if applicable)
Extra things to know, future work, modifications necessary for other people.
