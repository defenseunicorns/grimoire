# Policies

Sometimes cleaning up after a failed deployment of the IaC needed for DUBBD can get really messy (especially for the impatient). These scripts were used to help fascilitate a lot of hand cramps for manually clicking through removing policies. 


## delete_policies.sh

To use, run `delete_policies.sh <Preamble>`. Any policies matching the preample should be removed.

This script should take minimal effort to adjust for removing policies with a suffix or other identifier. Enjoy!
